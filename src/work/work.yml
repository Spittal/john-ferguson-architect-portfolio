    Completed 2023</p><br>
    <p>Perched upon a bedrock outcropping in the dense rainforest of Bowen Island, the Forest House house was
    designed for a young family of three seeking a lifestyle change from city living. The clients wanted their
    children to grow up in nature, but also wanted to have a refuge from it in the wetter, winter months.</p>
    <p>Careful attention was paid to minimize site impact and give the house a light footprint. The concrete foundation
    at either end of the house is scribed tight to the granite bedrock, anchoring the house to the site and allowing
    it to span between the rocks and float above the ground beneath.</p>
    <p>Natural materials such as Douglas Fir plywood and Western Red Cedar are used throughout the house to reference
    the native trees of the region and add a sense of warmth. Interior finishings are minimal and carefully curated to
    create a neutral palette and a sense of calmness. Skylights allow natural light to filter in - always changing
    throughout the day and providing framed views of the treetops above.</p>

    <p>The Tofino residence is conceived of as a cluster of simple buildings that together form a coherent ensemble. The
    house is comprised of three wings: the entry/guest wing, the communal wing, and the family wing. Each volume is
    carefully placed on the site in order to frame landscape courtyards, to align with curated views, and to preserve the
    numerous old growth firs and cedars on the property.</p>
    <p>There are a few key elements that define the house. The first is a continuous floating concrete foundation which is
    required to keep the house above tsunami flood levels, and to preserve the delicate marshy rainforest ecosystem of Tofino.
    The second is the douglas fir timber ceiling structure that is exposed throughout the house, which provides a feeling
    of warmth in an extremely rainy climate. The third are the large windows which frame carefully selected views into the
    landscape, while skylights in every double-height space fill the interiors with natural light in the more overcast months.</p><br>

    <p>The house was designed for a small family that loved their neighbourhood, but needed a more functional space that
    would better suit their lifestyle. The arrangement of rooms in the house inverts the typical residential layout by placing
    the kitchen, living and dining rooms on the upper floor, and instead locating the bedrooms on the entry level. This allows
    the living room to take advantage of views of the adjacent park, Burrard inlet and the North Shore mountains beyond,
    while providing privacy to the inward-facing bedrooms.</p>
    <p>The facade pattern is born out of fire rating requirements and a desire to utilize a generic / lower cost building material in
    an innovative way. The result is a bold, playful facade that plays with light and shadow to create a sense of depth and
    rhythm. The project utilizes LVL beams to span the width of the room without the need for additional supporting
    columns. Materials such as natural stone, board formed concrete and Douglas Fir are used throughout the project
    and create a sense of calm and a neutral backdrop for the owners to show their personality through art and furniture.</p><br>

    <p>Designed as a rural home for a growing family of five, the Cape Residence is located on a twenty-acre forested
    site on Cape Roger Curtis on Bowen Island. The house is rigorously organized around a densely planted central
    courtyard, blurring the boundary between landscape and architecture. A large overhanging roof provides a sense of
    continuity between exterior and interior spaces, while also providing protection from the wetter winter months.</p>
    <p>The house is situated on the landscape in a manner that minimizes the building footprint, preserving the delicate
    grassy bluff biome that is unique to the Cape. Continuous view corridors throughout the house are carefully oriented
    to connect with the immediate forest, a small clearing to the northeast, and an ocean view to the west.</p>
    <p>The program is arranged with more social spaces situated around the north and west edges of the courtyard, in order
    to take advantage of the filtered sunlight. Private and service spaces are arranged around the periphery, and adjacent to
    the forested slope of the site.</p><br>

    <p>In a city that struggles with the banality and sameness of contemporary development, the community of Inglewood exists
    as an anomaly. Inglewood has largely managed to preserve a great number of historic industrial typologies which have
    since been displaced to suburban industrial parks. In recent years, Inglewood has witnessed rapid gentrification as young
    start-up companies, breweries, galleries and restaurants move in, resulting in a great pressure to preserve and celebrate old
    industrial spaces.</p>
    <p>The Livery looks to support this shrinking small-scale industrial need, by providing new light industrial and commercial space to the
    neighbourhood. Architecturally, the project analyzes historical identities and manipulates them through a distortion of scale,
    a juxtaposition of materials, and the playful reinterpretation of traditional tectonics. The project also aims to blur together
    public and private space by framing an outdoor space to be used for pop-up markets and cultural events.</p><br>

    <p>The Calgary Japanese Community Association (CJCA) wanted to replace their aging facility with a new building
    that would address their declining social, cultural and environmental sustainability.</p>
    <p>Through researching sensitive cultural aspects of Japanese culture and Nikkei identity (Japanese Canadians), we
    encountered the notion of Kakehashi – a Japanese word for ‘bridge’. This led us towards developing a more inclusive
    program comprised of various Japanese cultural, social and educational facilities, eight affordable housing units
    and a daycare. Assembling the various programs around a shared courtyard encourages cross-pollination and
    social interaction amongst the various demographics and generations of the centre’s membership.</p>
    <p>The incomplete oval plan references Ma, the balance of mass and void. The ‘void’ developed into a contemporary
    interpretation of the Engawa – the traditional threshold between building and garden – providing not only an
    auxiliary space and access point for the various programs, but also framing the revered Japanese garden.</p><br>

    disassembled without any permanent fastening.</p>
    <p>Designed for disassembly, S(hovel) is destined for a philanthropic afterlife. Following their brief stint as a
    Warming Hut, the shovels were donated to Take Pride Winnipeg’s Snow Angel Program, a non-profit charity

    <p>When we first met with our client – a robotics design and manufacturing company called Attabotics - they
    made it clear they didn’t want a boring box. They wanted something that would create a collaborative and engaging
    work environment, something that would take respect and harness the potential of a pristine prairie landscape
    site, and something that would challenge the architectural culture of the city.</p>
    <p>With these asks in mind, we identified three design challenges: how do we accommodate the disparate needs
    of both office and manufacturing space? How do we take advantage of challenging airport bylaws, which restrict the
    building’s height? And how can the project foster a culture of openness, sharing and collaboration for its users?</p><br>

    <p>Alberta’s economy has been prone to a boom-bust fluctuation of growth and despair for many decades, which
    has a profound effect on the volatility of the real estate market. As such, it is becoming increasingly difficult as a
    small business to find an affordable space to lease, as land owners increasingly are not willing to risk the capital
    investment required to provide such low-return spaces in such a volatile market. Our client tasked us with finding an
    alternative - how can we provide small-scale, affordable commercial spaces to young businesses, while providing
    them with the flexibility to develop the site in the future? And all the while ensuring that the building is contributing to a
    resilient and sustainable future.</p>
    <p>We envision a project built entirely of pre-fab, off-the-shelf quonset components, in order to produce a building that
    can be readily erected, expanded upon, and disassembled at the end of its life-cycle. By incorporating principles of circular
    design, we can provide a low-cost, and sustainable project to the community of Edmonton.</p><br>

    <p>“The worker is at home when he is not working, and not at home when he is working” - Marx’s Capital p. 326.</p>
    <p>Labour in our society is becoming increasingly immaterial. The domicile itself is now a cognitive factory; no longer
    defined by the 9-to-5 workday and no longer tied to the office, WFH has eroded one of the last remaining
    boundaries between productive labour and social reproduction. Conversely, office space is being increasingly
    “domesticized” through residential furniture, snacks and perks, with the goal of concealing the ever-rising disparity
    between compensation and productivity in the post-Fordist neoliberal economy. How can, and should, architecture try
    to accommodate this less hermetic relationship between live and work?</p>
    <p>In addition, conventions of private ownership, nuclear family structures, and individual living are no longer totalistic -
    facing economic pressures, communities are exploring new approaches to domestic relations. What could a model for a
    more collective and collaborative living space could look like?</p><br>

    <p>The urban fabric of the contemporary neoliberal city is the disembowelment of collective form through speculative
    development and the commodification of real estate. The project is concerned with two broad themes: interiority and
    texture. The first is the hyper-internalization of the city, where private interest and profit-obsessed design has rendered the
    exterior condition of the city entirely sterile and abandoned. The city is understood as a manifestation of capital desire,
    where maximization and speculative economies have come to dominate the landscape. Architecture and the city have
    become liminal devices: fiscal imperatives of landscape production.</p>
    <p>The project segregates its citizens from this abandoned environ, resulting in a mode of inhabitation where every
    aspect of life is privatized and monetized as a subscription. In lieu of Public space, privately accessible outdoor space is
    projected into the tower block in spaces of lesser profitability. The resulting network of junk spaces left abandoned and
    neglected by the alienated occupants form a reverent monument to an irreverent system born out of myopic
    prescience. Crisscrossing and punctuating the terminal transept are a series of walkways, a harkening back to earlier
    attempts to internalize the city through the stratification of public space through +15’ networks.</p><br>
