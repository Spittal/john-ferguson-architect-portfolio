    <b>Firm:</b> SMSTUDIO<br>
    <p>Bowen Island, BC<br>
    Completed 2023<br>
    <p>Perched upon a bedrock outcropping in the dense rainforest of Bowen Island, the Forest House house was designed for a young family of three 
    seeking a lifestyle change from city living. The clients wanted their children to grow up in nature, 
    but also wanted to have a refuge from it in the wetter, winter months.</p>
    <p>Careful attention was paid to minimize site impact and give the house a light footprint. 
    The concrete foundation at either end of the house is scribed tight to the granite bedrock, 
    anchoring the house to the site and allowing it to span between the rocks and float above the ground beneath.</p>
    <p>Natural materials such as Douglas Fir plywood and Western Red Cedar are used throughout the house to reference 
    the native trees of the region and add a sense of warmth. Interior finishings are minimal and carefully curated to 
    create a neutral palette and a sense of calmness. Skylights allow natural light to filter in - 
    always changing throughout the day and providing framed views of the treetops above.</p>

    Permits 2023<br>
    <p>Designed as a rural home for a growing family of five, the Cape Residence is located on a twenty-acre forested
    site on Cape Roger Curtis on Bowen Island. The house is rigorously organized around a densely planted central
    courtyard, blurring the boundary between landscape and architecture. A large overhanging roof provides a sense of
    continuity between exterior and interior spaces, while also providing protection from the wetter winter months.</p>
    <p>The house is situated on the landscape in a manner that minimizes the building footprint, preserving the delicate
    grassy bluff biome that is unique to the Cape. Continuous view corridors throughout the house are carefully oriented
    to connect with the immediate forest, a small clearing to the northeast, and an ocean view to the west.</p>
    <p>The program is arranged with more social spaces situated around the north and west edges of the courtyard, in order
    to take advantage of the filtered sunlight. Private and service spaces are arranged around the periphery, and adjacent to
    the forested slope of the site..</p><br>
